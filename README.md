Stock Ticker Web App

This project was developed as part of the CS 20 Web Programming course at Tufts University. The goal was to build a full-stack application that allows users to look up public companies and their stock information using either a stock ticker or company name. It was completed in two parts using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and basic HTML/CSS.
